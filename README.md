# Biobank-Standardisation
Scripts and Data Quality Rules developed for my master’s thesis “Biobank Standardisation for Personalised Oncology: A Caste Study”. Code processes biobank specimen metadata, applies ISO 20387:2018 compliance checks and supports precision oncology. All workflows are already implemented and operational within the biobank environment.
